# Prediction-SC
Models for predicting the critical temperature are constructed on the widest base of superconductors. Based on the selection of features, the most important physical parameters were obtained for determining the critical temperature. Models of the best quality were built on the divided data on the number of chemical elements. The resulting models are used to model new superconducting materials. The resulting materials exceed the known used superconductors at a critical temperature.
## Code:
### MODEL_FEATURE_SELECTION - —Åode for model training and feature selection.
### NEW_SC - Code for predicting the critical temperature of new booster superconducting materials and creating the databases required for this.
## Initial Data:
### sc_min - superconducting material data with a minimum measured value;
### sc_mean - superconducting material data with a mean measured value;
### sc_max - superconducting material data with a max measured value;
## Data of positive, negative ions, metals for modeling:
### one_metals - metals
### one_plus - positive ions
### one_chast_plus - most common positive ions
### one_minus - negative ions

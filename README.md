# Prediction-SC
Models for predicting the critical temperature are constructed on the widest base of superconductors. Based on the selection of features, the most important physical parameters were obtained for determining the critical temperature. Models of the best quality were built on the divided data on the number of chemical elements. The resulting models are used to model new superconducting materials. The resulting materials exceed the known used superconductors at a critical temperature.
